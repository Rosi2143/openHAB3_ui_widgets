# tips and tricks
## Display State vs. State
* https://www.openhab.org/docs/ui/building-pages.html#dynamically-configuring-components-with-expressions

The @ symbol can be used in front of an item name string as a shortcut to the displayState from the items dictionary with a fallback to the raw state:

    footer: =@'Switch1'

is the same as

    footer: =items['Switch1'].displayState || items['Switch1'].state

Similarly, @@ can be used as a shortcut for just the item state.
